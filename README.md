# ComputeWeightOfVectorInCode
Code written for a discrete mathematics course, focusing on coding theory: 
1. find_min_weight.py: determining the minimum weight of a vector over a code in a finite (Galois field).
2. find_coset_leaders.py: Find all the syndromes from the complete list of code words, and also the corresponding
coset leaders for those syndromes, given a list of all the codewords, the parity check matrix, and the size
of the finite field.
